## Further information
With the above commands the following jobs are executed: 
1. Data import and extraction.
2. Data preparation.
3. Translation of textual data into numerical vectors.
4. Extraction of t topics and the n most important words per topic.

When the above terminal commands are executed, the user is asked to enter the number of topics that should be extracted and the number of most important keywords per topic that should be given.
The final output compares the results of two semantic analysis algorithms with two different vectorization techniques, respectively.
In addition, the percentage of documents being assigned to each extracted topic is given. Finally, the semantic context of single words can be explored.
